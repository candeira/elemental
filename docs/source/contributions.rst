Adding functionality is easy
----------------------------

The `Elemental source code <https://github.com/red-and-black/elemental>`_ is
simple, clean and well-organised.

Take a look at it and you'll see what we mean!

The four main modules are ``actions.py``, ``getters.py``, ``states.py`` and
``values.py``. You can guess what sort of functionality each one contains.

As a result it's easy to work with and add to.


Pull requests are encouraged
----------------------------

If Elemental lacks some functionality which you need, fork the repo and add it
in.

Then send us a pull request.

We're friendly and happy to work with you -- no matter what your level of
experience -- to get your PR merged into Elemental and released promptly.
